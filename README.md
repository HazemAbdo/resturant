## Yes, it is time to farewell bits and bytes and start working with stacks of wheat packs, queues of customers' orders and loops of Swiss roll.
### You can use computer simulation to assess and enhance their service

# Modes Of simulation
## Interactive mode:
allows user to monitor the restaurant operation. 
At each time step, program should provide output similar to that in the figure. In this mode, program pauses for a user mouse click to display the output of the next timestep. 
## Step-by-step mode:
identical to interactive mode except that each time step, the program waits for one second (not for mouse click) then resumes automatically.

## silent mode:
the program produces only an output file. It does not draw anything graphically.
